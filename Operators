/* 

Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.
Test Data:
Input first number: 125
Input second number: 24
Expected Output :
125 + 24 = 149
125 - 24 = 101
125 x 24 = 3000
125 / 24 = 5
125 mod 24 = 5

*/  


//Sample solution :
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int a = 125;
        int b = 25;
        
        System.out.println("Addition of numbers is :- " + a+b);
        
        System.out.println("Subtraction of numbers is :- " + (a - b));
        
        System.out.println("Multiplication of numbers is :- " + a*b);
        
        System.out.println("Division of numbers is :- " + a/b);
        
        System.out.println("Remainder of numbers is :- " + a%b);
    }
}


//Sample solution using input from the user:
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the First number :- ");
        int num1 = sc.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter the Second number :- ");
        int num2 = sc.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println("Addition of numbers is :- " + (num1+num2));
        
        System.out.println("Subtraction of numbers is :- " + (num1-num2));
        
        System.out.println("Multiplication of numbers is :- " + (num1*num2));
        
        System.out.println("Division of numbers is :- " + (num1/num2));
        
        System.out.println("Remainder of numbers is :- " + (num1%num2));
    }
}
